# Just Another Text Editor

## Description

There are a lot of text editors in the world. Some have smart syntax that will help auto complete code snippets. Some have linters that will help organize your code in an easy to read format. If those things annoy you can use Just Another Text Editor, or JATE for short. No more of that pesky, annoying format technology. Just a simple, plain, boring text editor. Keep it simple and edit text old fashioned way with JATE.
